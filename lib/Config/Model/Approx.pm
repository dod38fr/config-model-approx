This module provides a configuration editor for Approx. Running L<cme> as root
will update C</etc/approx/approc.conf>.

This module and Config::Model can also be used from Perl programs to
modify safely the content of F</etc/approx/approx.conf>.

The Perl API is documented in L<Config::Model> and mostly in
L<Config::Model::Node>.
